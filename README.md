<h2>🚀 What I'm Currently Working On</h2>
<br>
📈 Predictive Modeling: Currently researching and implementing advanced statistical and deep learning models for time-series data, with a specific focus on capturing seasonality, trend, and external factors for more accurate predictions.
<br>
🧠 Deep Learning: Developing a multi-variate deep learning model using Keras/TensorFlow, such as an LSTM-based architecture, to analyze and predict complex patterns in interconnected datasets.
<br>
<h2>📂 My Projects</h2>
📊 Chicago Crime Analysis and Forecasting: Analyzed temporal and geospatial patterns, identified district-level crime disparities, quantified seasonality, and highlighted high-frequency periods (rush-hour, monthly, and holiday peaks) for strategic resource deployment. Constructed models for key offenses (Theft, Narcotics) to accurately forecast future crime rates, providing data-driven intelligence for proactive planning.
<br>
💉 Maternal Mortality Prediction: Developed a robust multiclass classification model to accurately assess fetal health (Normal, Suspect, or Pathological) and achieved strong micro-average performance metrics: Precision 89%, Recall 88%, and F1-Score 88%.
<br>
📊 Sales Prediction Project: Built a linear regression model for sales prediction, achieving a robust performance metric with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of $1,092.
<br>
🧑‍💼 Adult Incomes Prediction Project: Applied random forest and neural network models, achieving ~86% accuracy with the Random Forest model.
<br>
❤️ Heart Diseases Prediction Project: Applied a neural network model, achieving ~86% accuracy. 
<br>
✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction Project: Applied a neural network model, achieving ~92% accuracy. Used clustering techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on behavioral features, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized service offerings.
